# GCN_with_ASIC_Design
This project involves a synthesizable RTL implementation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in System Verilog, optimized for power and area efficiency. The design achieves a latency of 0.0001 ms, occupying an area of 49,018 μm², with a power consumption of 7.952 mW at 667 MHz. Key features include static timing analysis with buffer adjustments to resolve timing issues, a combinational logic module for efficient memory operations, and an Argmax module using finite state machines for enhanced processing speed. The GCN core comprises 30,881 gates with gate-level optimizations for performance and efficiency.
